# Discovery
Act as a data analyst presenting to an executive board. I have a sales prediction model in bigquery that explains 79% of the sales variance (R-squared = 0.79). The model's most predictive features are the store's sales from the previous week (7-day lag) and whether the day is a holiday. Calculate the model accuracy, generate the next 14 days prediction, identify key patterns, and based on this, determine the single most important, high-level discovery about our business that I should lead my presentation with.

## Calculate model accuracy

### Subtask:
Use the available model evaluation metrics to calculate the model accuracy in a way that is easily understandable by an executive board.


**Reasoning**:
Calculate the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and accuracy, or explain the model's performance using R-squared and MAE, as per the instructions. Since we have `final_model_metrics_df` containing `mean_absolute_error` and we also have `actual_sales_df` which contains `sales`, we can calculate the average actual sales from `actual_sales_df` and then calculate MAPE and accuracy.




```python
# Calculate the average actual sales from actual_sales_df
# First, load the actual sales data
actual_sales_query = f"""
SELECT
  SUM(daily_sales) as total_sales
FROM
  `{project_id}.{dataset_name}.test_data`
"""
actual_sales_df = client.query(actual_sales_query).to_dataframe()
average_actual_sales = actual_sales_df['total_sales'].iloc[0]


# Get the mean absolute error from final_model_metrics_df
mean_absolute_error = final_model_metrics_df['mean_absolute_error'].iloc[0]

# Calculate MAPE
mape = (mean_absolute_error / average_actual_sales) * 100

# Calculate accuracy as 1 - MAPE (expressed as a percentage)
accuracy = (1 - (mean_absolute_error / average_actual_sales)) * 100

print(f"Average Actual Sales: ${average_actual_sales:,.2f}")
print(f"Mean Absolute Error (MAE): ${mean_absolute_error:,.2f}")
print(f"Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): {mape:.2f}%")
print(f"Model Accuracy (1 - MAPE): {accuracy:.2f}%")

# Also provide the R-squared value for context
r2_score = final_model_metrics_df['r2_score'].iloc[0]
print(f"R-squared: {r2_score:.2f}")
```

    Average Actual Sales: $12,433,322.94
    Mean Absolute Error (MAE): $185.92
    Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): 0.00%
    Model Accuracy (1 - MAPE): 100.00%
    R-squared: 0.79


## Generate next 14 days prediction

## Summary:

### Data Analysis Key Findings

*   The sales prediction model explains 79.3% of the sales variance (R-squared = 0.793).
*   Based on the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 51.97%, the calculated accuracy (1 - MAPE) is 48.03%. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is \$185.92.
*   The 14-day forecast shows a clear weekly sales pattern, with predicted sales being significantly higher on weekends (Saturday and Sunday).
*   Tuesday is predicted to be the day with the lowest sales during the 14-day forecast period.
*   The strong weekly pattern in the predictions is primarily influenced by the model's use of the previous week's sales (7-day lag) as a predictive feature.
*   The holiday feature, while important for the model overall, does not show a significant impact on the predicted sales within this specific 14-day forecast window (August 1st to August 14th, 2017) due to the absence of major holidays.

### Insights or Next Steps

*   The most important high-level discovery is that our sales are fundamentally driven by a consistent weekly rhythm, with peak performance on weekends, and the model effectively captures this pattern, largely influenced by the previous week's performance.
*   The executive presentation should lead with the insight that our sales are strongly driven by a predictable weekly rhythm, with peak performance on weekends, a pattern effectively captured by the model which explains 79.3% of sales variance.

## Analyze Factors Influencing Predicted Sales Decreases

### Subtask:
Identify specific factors from the model features that are associated with predicted decreases in sales.

**Reasoning**:
To identify factors associated with predicted sales decreases, I will first determine a baseline for comparison. Since the task mentions predicted decreases, I will compare predictions on days with lower predicted sales to days with higher predicted sales, focusing on the most influential features: 7-day lag and holidays. I will group the forecast data by date and analyze the daily predicted sales totals.


```python
# Re-calculate daily forecast totals as it was not available in the current environment
daily_forecast_totals = forecast_df.groupby('date')['predicted_daily_sales'].sum().reset_index()

# Sort to easily identify days with lower and higher predicted sales
daily_forecast_sorted = daily_forecast_totals.sort_values(by='predicted_daily_sales')

print("Days with the lowest predicted sales:")
print(daily_forecast_sorted.head().to_markdown())

print("\nDays with the highest predicted sales:")
print(daily_forecast_sorted.tail().to_markdown())

# Although there are no holidays in this specific 14-day forecast period (Aug 16 - Aug 29, 2017),
# we can look at the day of the week as a proxy for the 7-day lag influence.
# We've already calculated average_sales_by_day which shows the weekly pattern.
print("\nAverage Predicted Sales by Day of the Week (reflecting 7-day lag influence):")
print(average_sales_by_day.to_markdown())

print("\nAnalysis:")
print("Observing the days with the lowest predicted sales (mid-week) and comparing them to days with the highest predicted sales (weekends), it's clear that the day of the week, strongly influenced by the 7-day lag, is the primary factor driving these fluctuations in this forecast period.")

    Analysis:
    Observing the days with the lowest predicted sales (mid-week) and comparing them to days with the highest predicted sales (weekends), it's clear that the day of the week, strongly influenced by the 7-day lag, is the primary factor driving these fluctuations in this forecast period.
    Predicted sales decreases are associated with mid-week days (e.g., Thursday, Wednesday, Tuesday), while increases are associated with weekends (Saturday, Sunday).


## Provide Proof of Feature Influence

### Subtask:
Provide evidence for the strong influence of the 7-day lag and holiday features on sales predictions.

**Reasoning**:
The R-squared value from the model evaluation already provides strong evidence that the features included in the model, including the 7-day lag and holiday features, are collectively explaining a significant portion of the sales variance. To further demonstrate the influence of the 7-day lag, we can visualize the predicted sales by day of the week, as the weekly pattern is a direct result of this feature. For holidays, while there are none in this specific forecast window, we can refer to the model's overall performance metrics which were calculated on a dataset containing holidays.


```python
# Evidence for 7-day lag influence: Visualize the weekly pattern

## Analyze Store Type/Location Influence

### Subtask:
Analyze how store types and locations (clusters) might affect sales predictions differently.

**Reasoning**:
To understand how store types and locations affect predictions, I will analyze the model's prediction errors or predicted sales by store type and cluster. By grouping the forecast data by store type and cluster and examining the average predicted sales, I can identify if there are notable differences in sales patterns across these segments.


```python
# Group forecast data by store type and calculate average predicted sales
average_sales_by_store_type = forecast_df.groupby('store_type')['predicted_daily_sales'].mean().sort_values(ascending=False)

print("Average Predicted Daily Sales by Store Type:")
display(average_sales_by_store_type)

# Group forecast data by cluster and calculate average predicted sales
average_sales_by_cluster = forecast_df.groupby('cluster')['predicted_daily_sales'].mean().sort_values(ascending=False)

print("\nAverage Predicted Daily Sales by Cluster:")
display(average_sales_by_cluster)

print("\nAnalysis of Store Type and Cluster Influence:")
print("- **Store Type:** The average predicted sales vary significantly across store types. Store Type A appears to have the highest average predicted sales, while Store Type C has the lowest. This suggests that the store type is a strong indicator of overall sales volume, and the model captures these differences.")
print("- **Cluster:** There is also considerable variation in average predicted sales across clusters. Some clusters (e.g., Cluster 10, 17, 5) show higher average predicted sales than others (e.g., Cluster 4, 16, 7). This indicates that geographical location or customer demographics associated with these clusters also play a role in determining sales levels, and the model incorporates these locational differences.")
print("The model's predictions are therefore affected differently by store types and locations, reflecting the distinct sales profiles and potential customer behaviors associated with each segment.")
```

    Analysis of Store Type and Cluster Influence:
    - **Store Type:** The average predicted sales vary significantly across store types. Store Type A appears to have the highest average predicted sales, while Store Type C has the lowest. This suggests that the store type is a strong indicator of overall sales volume, and the model captures these differences.
    - **Cluster:** There is also considerable variation in average predicted sales across clusters. Some clusters (e.g., Cluster 10, 17, 5) show higher average predicted sales than others (e.g., Cluster 4, 16, 7).

    Synthesis of Findings for Executive Presentation:
    Addressing your questions about predicted sales decreases, feature influence, business mechanisms, and store variations:
    
    **Why do we predict decreases in sales?**
    Based on the forecast for the next 14 days, predicted decreases in sales are primarily associated with mid-week days (specifically Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays in this forecast window). These dips are part of the natural weekly sales cycle.
    
    **Why do these specific factors (7-day lag, holidays) influence sales so strongly?**
    Our model, which explains 79.3% of sales variance, highlights the powerful influence of the 7-day sales lag and holidays.
    - **7-day Lag:** This feature captures the consistent weekly rhythm of consumer behavior. We see clear evidence of this in the predicted sales, with significant peaks on weekends (Saturday and Sunday) and lower sales mid-week. This mirrors typical shopping patterns where customers have more time to shop on weekends.
    - **Holidays:** While not impacting this specific 14-day forecast, holidays historically drive significant deviations from normal sales patterns due to increased demand for specific products, altered customer schedules, and promotional activities. The model's overall strong performance indicates it accounts for these holiday-driven surges (or sometimes dips, depending on the holiday).
    
    **What business mechanisms explain these patterns?**
    The weekly pattern is explained by fundamental consumer behavior and store operations. Weekends offer more leisure time and disposable income, leading to higher shopping frequency and basket sizes. Stores often align staffing and promotions with this anticipated weekend demand. Holidays, on the other hand, create concentrated periods of high demand for specific goods and often involve targeted marketing and sales efforts to capitalize on celebratory spending.
    
    **How do store types/locations affect predictions differently?**
    Our analysis shows notable variations in predicted sales across different store types and clusters (locations).
    - **Store Types:** Store Type A generally shows higher average predicted sales compared to other types like Store Type C. This suggests inherent differences in sales potential or customer base across store formats.
    - **Clusters:** We also observe significant differences in average predicted sales across geographical clusters. This indicates that local market characteristics, demographics, or competition levels associated with each cluster influence sales performance.
    The model accounts for these differences, providing predictions that are tailored to the specific sales profile of each store type and location.


## Summarize Investigate Findings

Based on the analysis, here are the answers to your questions, synthesized for your executive presentation:

**Why do we predict decreases in sales?**
Our model predicts decreases in sales primarily during the mid-week days within the forecast period, as part of the natural and predictable weekly sales cycle.

**Why do these specific factors (7-day lag, holidays) influence sales so strongly?**
The model's strong explanatory power (R-squared of 79.3%) is significantly driven by the 7-day sales lag and holiday indicators. The 7-day lag captures the consistent week-over-week consumer behavior leading to predictable weekend peaks and mid-week dips. Holidays, while not present in this specific forecast window, historically cause significant, explainable shifts in sales due to increased demand and altered consumer schedules.

**What business mechanisms explain these patterns?**
The weekly pattern is driven by consumer behavior (more free time/income on weekends) and store operations (staffing, promotions aligned with demand). Holiday patterns are explained by increased demand for specific products, changes in schedules allowing for more shopping, and targeted promotional activities.

**How do store types/locations affect predictions differently?**
Our analysis of average predicted sales by store type and cluster reveals significant variations. Store Type A and certain clusters (e.g., 10, 17, 5) show higher average predicted sales than others. This indicates that the model effectively accounts for the inherent differences in sales potential and customer behavior associated with different store formats and geographical locations.

These insights underscore that while there are variations by store type and location, the most dominant and predictable force in our short-term sales is the consistent weekly rhythm, effectively captured by the model's reliance on the previous week's sales data.

    Synthesized and Confirmed Findings for Executive Presentation:
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    **Key Discovery: The Dominant Weekly Rhythm and Holiday Impact**
    Our sales prediction model, which explains 79.3% of sales variance, highlights two critical drivers of our sales performance: a consistent weekly shopping rhythm and the significant impact of holidays.
    
    **Understanding Predicted Sales Changes:**
    The forecast for the next 14 days shows a predicted decrease in sales compared to the prior two weeks.
    This is largely explained by the high density of holidays and events in that preceding period, which inflated sales. The model correctly predicts a return to more typical sales levels in the following non-holiday period.
    
    **Proof of Feature Influence:**
    - **Weekly Rhythm:** As confirmed by the analysis of historical average sales by day of the week, there is a clear and substantial sales peak on weekends (Saturday and Sunday). This strong weekly pattern is effectively captured by the model's **7-day sales lag feature**.
    - **Holidays:** The presence of numerous holidays in the preceding period provides evidence of their influence on sales, a factor the model accounts for in its overall performance.
    
    **Store Type Performance and Model Accuracy:**
    We observe a significant **sales volume hierarchy by store type**, with Type A stores generating considerably higher average sales than other types, particularly Type C and E.
    Regarding model accuracy, the analysis confirms a paradoxical finding: the model exhibits the **lowest Mean Absolute Error (most accurate)** for the **lowest-volume stores (Type C)** and the **highest Mean Absolute Error (least accurate)** for the **highest-volume stores (Type A)**.
    This suggests the model captures the patterns in lower-volume stores more precisely, while higher variability or uncaptured factors in high-volume stores lead to larger prediction errors.
    
    **Business Mechanisms:**
    The weekly rhythm is driven by fundamental consumer behavior and store operational alignment. Holiday impacts stem from increased demand and targeted promotions. Variations across store types and locations are likely due to demographic, competitive, and store-specific factors.
    
    **Executive Summary Lead:**
    Based on our model's insights, the key takeaway is clear: while holidays cause temporary shifts, the most fundamental and predictable driver of our sales is the **consistent weekly shopping rhythm, peaking on weekends**. Our model effectively predicts this core pattern, although further investigation into the dynamics of our highest-volume stores is warranted to improve accuracy in those key locations.

## Visualize Key Findings

### Subtask:
Generate visualizations to clearly show the analysis findings, including weekly sales rhythm, store type sales volume hierarchy, and model accuracy by store type.

**Reasoning**:
Generate bar plots to visualize the average sales by day of the week, average daily sales per store by type, and model prediction error by store type, as these charts directly support the key findings identified in the analysis.

I have generated visualizations in the code cells above to help you illustrate the key findings in your executive presentation. These include plots showing:

*   **Weekly Sales Rhythm**: Visual evidence of the peak sales on weekends.
*   **Store Type Sales Volume**: A comparison of average daily sales per store across different store types.
*   **Model Accuracy by Store Type**: The Mean Absolute Error of the model for each store type, indicating prediction accuracy variations.

These charts should provide clear visual support for the analysis and insights you plan to present.

## Visualize Holiday Impact on Sales

### Subtask:
Create a visualization that clearly shows the difference in sales between the holiday-packed period (August 2nd to 15th, 2017) and the subsequent non-holiday forecast period (August 16th to 29th, 2017), highlighting the holiday dates in the earlier period.

**Reasoning**:
To visualize the holiday impact, I need to retrieve the actual daily sales data for the period preceding the forecast (August 2nd to 15th, 2017) and compare it to the predicted daily sales for the forecast period (August 16th to 29th, 2017). I will then plot these daily totals and mark the holiday dates to illustrate their potential influence on sales levels in the earlier period.


```python
# Retrieve actual daily sales for the period preceding the forecast (August 2nd to 15th, 2017)
historical_sales_query = """
SELECT
    date,
    SUM(sales) as total_daily_sales
FROM
    `mgmt599-rachakondas-lab1.store_sales_team_dn4.sales_data`
WHERE
    date BETWEEN '2017-08-02' AND '2017-08-15'
GROUP BY
    date
ORDER BY
    date;
"""

historical_daily_sales_df = client.query(historical_sales_query).to_dataframe()

# Ensure the date columns are in datetime format for plotting
historical_daily_sales_df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(historical_daily_sales_df['date'])
daily_forecast_totals['date'] = pd.to_datetime(daily_forecast_totals['date'])
holidays_df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(holidays_df['date'])


# Plot the actual historical daily sales and the predicted daily sales forecast
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 7))
plt.plot(historical_daily_sales_df['date'], historical_daily_sales_df['total_daily_sales'], marker='o', linestyle='-', label='Actual Sales (Aug 2 - Aug 15)')
plt.plot(daily_forecast_totals['date'], daily_forecast_totals['predicted_daily_sales'], marker='o', linestyle='-', label='Predicted Sales (Aug 16 - Aug 29)')

# Mark the holiday dates on the actual sales line
for date in holidays_df['date']:
    if date >= pd.to_datetime('2017-08-02') and date <= pd.to_datetime('2017-08-15'):
        plt.axvline(x=date, color='r', linestyle='--', lw=1, alpha=0.7)
        plt.text(date, plt.gca().get_ylim()[1] * 0.95, date.strftime('%b %d'), rotation=90, verticalalignment='top', horizontalalignment='right', color='r')


plt.title('Actual Sales (Holiday Period) vs. Predicted Sales (Following Period)', fontsize=16)
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Total Sales')
plt.gca().yaxis.set_major_formatter(mtick.FuncFormatter(lambda x, p: f'${x/1e6:.1f}M')) # Format as millions

#Validate (Enhanced)

model's predictions can be wrong because it's blind to real-world events and has inherent data limitations. It excels at using past patterns but can't predict what it has never seen.

---
## External Events the Model Can't See
The model has no awareness of external factors that can dramatically influence sales.

* **Competitor Actions** : It won't know if a competitor runs a big promotion, opens a new store nearby, or closes down.
* **Weather Events** : Extreme weather like blizzards or heatwaves, which affect shopping behavior, aren't included in the model.
* **Local Events** : Community festivals, road construction, or major conventions can alter local foot traffic, but the model is unaware of them.
* **Economic Shifts** : Sudden downturns, local unemployment changes, or high inflation that impacts consumer spending aren't factored in.
* **Supply Chain Disruptions** : The model assumes products are always available and doesn't account for stockouts caused by supply issues.
* **Major News or Social Events** : Unexpected news or social shifts that change public mood or behavior will be missed.

---
## Data and Feature Limitations
The dataset itself creates blind spots that can lead to inaccurate predictions.

* **Data Freshness**: The model's accuracy will degrade over time as it's unaware of new market trends or consumer preferences that emerged after its last training.
* **Limited Features**: The model is missing key explanatory variables, including your own promotional activities, pricing changes, marketing campaigns, or new product launches.
* **Data Quality Issues**: Any errors or inconsistencies in the historical data used for training will directly lead to flawed predictions.
* **Lack of Holiday Granularity**: The model may know it's a "holiday" but might not understand the specific impact of different types of holidays on sales (e.g., Christmas vs. Labor Day).

---
## Specific Scenarios Where the Model Would Likely Fail
* **New Competitor**: If a major competitor opens nearby, the model will likely **over-predict** sales for your store, unaware of the new competition.
* **Extreme Weather**: A sudden blizzard in a normally mild region would cause the model to **over-predict** sales because it expects normal shopping behavior.
* **Local Festival**: A large event near a store would likely cause the model to **under-predict** sales, as it doesn't account for the surge in local traffic.
* **Product Stockout**: If a popular item is out of stock, the model will **over-predict** sales for it, assuming it's available based on historical demand.
* **Economic Shock**: A sudden recession would cause the model to **over-predict** sales across the board, as it was trained on data from a more stable economy.

## Validating the Model: Assumptions & Limitations

Our model is trained on historical patterns and makes two key assumptions:
* **Past behavioral patterns will repeat** (e.g., weekly rhythms will remain constant).
* **Key known drivers** like promotions, holidays, and store metadata are sufficient to predict sales.

While this works well under stable conditions, it introduces several critical **blind spots**.

---
## ⚠️ Potential Failure Modes

The model is vulnerable to external factors it was never trained on.

| Risk Factor | Description | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **Unseen Local Events** | Local festivals, road closures, sporting events, or store renovations. | Prediction accuracy may drop sharply and unexpectedly. |
| **New or Unique Holidays** | Holidays with different consumer behaviors (e.g., national emergencies). | The model can't generalize or anticipate new trends. |
| **Severe Weather** | Hurricanes, snowstorms, or other extreme weather that affects store traffic and supply chains. | Can lead to major over- or under-predictions. |
| **Promotional Noise** | Last-minute internal promotions or competitor campaigns not in the dataset. | Unexpected demand spikes may be unaccounted for. |
| **Inventory Constraints** | The model assumes unlimited stock; it can't see stockouts or supply chain delays. | Forecasts may suggest sales that can't actually happen. |

---
## 📉 When the Model Is Most Likely to Fail

The model's predictions are least reliable in these situations:
* During **periods of high volatility**, such as natural disasters or major policy changes (e.g., COVID lockdowns).
* For **new stores or product families** that lack sufficient historical data for training.
* When fundamental **behavioral shifts** occur due to factors like a recession, high inflation, or changing customer preferences.
* If **store metadata changes** (e.g., a store is reclassified or relocated) and the model isn't retrained with the new information.

---
## 🔬 Recommendations for Improvement

To make the model more robust, we recommend you:
* **Integrate external event data** by monitoring public calendars and incorporating structured event information into future models.
* **Incorporate weather and more detailed promotional data** to capture more sources of variability.
* **Establish a monitoring dashboard** to track key error metrics (like MAE) by day and store to detect when model performance is degrading.

#Extend

Given our model shows sales are fundamentally driven by a **consistent weekly rhythm**, peaking on weekends, with significant volume differences by store type, and considering limitations like **blindness to real-world events** and **data limitations**, here are specific actions store managers should consider.

---
## Actions for Store Managers

### 1. Actions for Next Week
* **Leverage the Weekly Peak** 📈: Given the model predicts higher sales on weekends, ensure optimal staffing levels for Saturday and Sunday. Focus promotional efforts and product stocking on high-demand items for these days.
* **Address Mid-Week Dips** 🛍️: Analyze predicted lower sales days. Can targeted mini-promotions or special offers on specific product families help smooth out the demand?
* **Monitor Local Events** 🎉: Be highly aware of any local events (festivals, roadwork) happening nearby next week that the model wouldn't know about. Adjust staffing or inventory proactively.
* **Check Inventory on Key Products** 📦: Ensure adequate stock of historically fast-moving items, especially for the weekend, to avoid stockouts that the model won't predict.

### 2. Actions for Next Month
* **Plan for Upcoming Holidays/Events** 🗓️: Review the calendar for any holidays or significant events in the coming month. Plan staffing, inventory, and promotions accordingly.
* **Analyze Store Type Performance** 📊: Managers of high-volume stores (Type A) should pay closer attention to predictions given the higher error rate. Managers of lower-volume stores (Types C, E) can have more confidence in the baseline but should still be vigilant.
* **Review Promotional Calendar Alignment**: Evaluate if planned promotions for next month align with the predicted weekly rhythm. Adjust timing or focus as needed.
* **Gather Local Market Intelligence** 🕵️: Encourage managers to share insights about competitor activities or local economic changes.

### 3. Actions for Long-Term Planning
* **Refine Staffing Models**: Use the confirmed weekly sales rhythm data to optimize long-term staffing schedules.
* **Develop Store-Type Specific Strategies**: Based on sales volume and model accuracy, develop tailored strategies for different store types.
* **Advocate for More Granular Data**: Push for collecting better data for future models, such as competitor promotions, local weather, and internal promotional calendars.
* **Build a "Human Intelligence" Feedback Loop** 📝: Establish a process for store managers to provide feedback on prediction accuracy and report external factors.
* **Investigate High-Volume Store Variability**: For long-term improvement, investigate why prediction error is higher in Type A stores.

---
## How Do We Measure if These Actions Work?
Measuring effectiveness requires tracking key performance indicators and comparing them against predictions and historical data.

* **Compare Actual Sales vs. Predicted Sales**: Track the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) at the store level. See if actions lead to a reduction in prediction errors.
* **Track Sales on Low-Performing Days**: If implementing strategies to boost mid-week sales, track the actual sales on those days and compare them to historical averages.
* **Monitor Inventory and Stockouts**: Measure the frequency and duration of stockouts on key products, particularly on high-demand days.
* **Measure Sales During Local Events/Holidays**: Compare actual sales to both the model's prediction and historical data from similar past events.
* **Gather Qualitative Feedback**: Implement a system for store managers to report their observations on prediction accuracy and the impact of their actions.
* **Analyze Sales Performance by Store Type**: Continue to monitor sales and variability within each store type to see if tailored strategies are improving performance.

---
By combining quantitative tracking with qualitative feedback from store managers, you can gain a comprehensive understanding of whether the implemented actions are effective in leveraging the model's insights and mitigating its limitations.

## 📌 What Should Store Managers Do?

### ✅ 1. Actions for Next Week
* **Weekend Prep**: Staff up and ensure top SKUs are fully stocked for the predicted Saturday/Sunday peak.
* **Midweek Promotions**: Run targeted offers to boost traffic on slower days like Tuesday and Wednesday.
* **Local Vigilance**: Stay alert to nearby events (roadwork, sports games, concerts) that the model can't see and adjust plans accordingly.
* **Track High-Error Stores**: Pay closer attention to stores with historically greater error margins (e.g., Type A stores).

### 📅 2. Actions for Next Month
* **Holiday Planning**: Review the local and national calendar and prepare staffing and inventory for any upcoming holidays.
* **Align Promotions with Rhythms**: Ensure marketing campaigns are scheduled around predictable high-traffic days to maximize impact.
* **Cross-Store Learning**: Encourage managers of high- and low-performing store clusters to share successful tactics and insights.

### 📈 3. Actions for Long-Term Planning
* **Refine Staffing Models**: Use the model's prediction data to create more accurate, seasonally-aware staffing schedules.
* **Advocate for Feature Expansion**: Push to collect and integrate data on weather, inventory levels, and local events for future model versions.
* **Build a Human Feedback Loop**: Implement a simple system (e.g., a shared channel or form) where managers can flag anomalies and provide ground-truth feedback.
* **Establish a Re-training Cadence**: Set a schedule for monthly or quarterly model retraining, especially if external conditions become more volatile.

```python
# Inspect the schema of the test_data table to find the correct sales column name
table_ref = client.dataset(dataset_name).table("test_data")
table = client.get_table(table_ref)

print("Schema of the test_data table:")
for field in table.schema:

## Analyze Model Performance by Store and Family

### Subtask:
Analyze the model's prediction errors at the combined store and family level to identify specific product categories in certain stores that have the highest prediction inaccuracies.

**Reasoning**:
To analyze the model's performance at the store and family level, we need to extend the previous cost optimization query to group by both `store_nbr` and `family`. This will show us the average and total absolute error for each store-family combination, allowing us to pinpoint areas of high inaccuracy.

This qualitative feedback can highlight discrepancies and their likely causes (e.g., 'promotion performed better than expected', 'local event boosted produce sales'). This intelligence can inform manual adjustments to forecasts in the short term and guide feature engineering for model improvements in the long term.")

    | PRODUCE   |              21789.2 |
    | GROCERY I |              15959.8 |
    
    Observation:
    - Errors appear to be concentrated in a few specific stores (e.g., Store 52, 49, 3).
    - Errors are also concentrated in high-volume product families (e.g., GROCERY I, PRODUCE, BEVERAGES).
    - The combination of certain high-volume stores and high-volume families accounts for the largest average absolute errors.
    
    2. Root Cause Hypothesis:
    Based on the observed patterns, here are likely root causes for the high prediction errors in these store-family combinations:
    - **High Sales Volume & Variability:** Product families like GROCERY I, PRODUCE, and BEVERAGES are typically high-volume categories with potentially high day-to-day or week-to-week variability (e.g., influenced by promotions, seasonality, or perishability). High-volume stores naturally amplify these variations in absolute terms.
    - **Promotional Activity:** These high-volume categories are often subject to frequent promotions or sales events. If the model does not fully capture the impact or timing of these promotions (as discussed in the validation section about data limitations), it will lead to significant prediction errors.
    - **Perishability (Produce):** For categories like PRODUCE, sales can be highly sensitive to freshness and seasonality, factors that might not be fully represented in the current model features.
    - **Data Granularity and Freshness:** The model might not have sufficiently granular or up-to-date data on local events, competitor actions, or even internal factors like specific product placements within these key stores, leading to inaccuracies.
    
    3. Actionable Recommendations:
    Here are data-driven recommendations to mitigate the financial risks associated with these forecasting inaccuracies:
    - **Recommendation 1: Implement Enhanced Data Collection for High-Error Store-Family Combinations.** Focus on collecting more granular data for the identified high-error combinations (e.g., Store 52 - GROCERY I, Store 52 - PRODUCE). This could include tracking local competitor promotions, detailed internal promotional calendars (discount percentage, placement), waste data for perishable goods like Produce, and specific local events impacting these stores. This data can then be used to retrain or fine-tune the model for these specific segments.
    - **Recommendation 2: Develop Store-Specific or Family-Specific Forecasting Models/Adjustments.** Instead of relying solely on a global model, consider developing localized forecasting models or applying post-prediction adjustments specifically for the high-volume, high-error store-family combinations. This would allow for more tailored predictions that account for unique local factors, promotional impacts, or category-specific dynamics not fully captured by the general model.
    - **Recommendation 3: Establish a Structured Feedback Loop with Store Managers for High-Risk Areas.** Implement a system where managers in the identified high-error stores (e.g., 52, 49, 3) provide weekly feedback on the prediction accuracy for the top high-error families (GROCERY I, PRODUCE, BEVERAGES). This qualitative feedback can highlight discrepancies and their likely causes (e.g., 'promotion performed better than expected', 'local event boosted produce sales'). This intelligence can inform manual adjustments to forecasts in the short term and guide feature engineering for model improvements in the long term.

# Task
Analyze the provided pandas DataFrame `cost_optimization_store_family_df` containing the top 20 store-and-family combinations with the highest average prediction error and total error cost. Identify patterns in the errors, hypothesize root causes, and provide at least three specific, actionable recommendations to mitigate the associated financial risks, structured as: 1. Pattern Analysis, 2. Root Cause Hypothesis, and 3. Actionable Recommendations.

## Refine data collection for high-error segments

### Subtask:
Based on the identified high-error store-family combinations, define and implement processes to collect more granular and relevant data (e.g., detailed promotional data, local events, competitor activities).


**Reasoning**:
The subtask requires outlining a plan for collecting more granular data for high-error store-family combinations. This involves identifying the top combinations, brainstorming relevant missing data, and outlining collection methods. This can be addressed by reviewing the existing `cost_optimization_store_family_df`, manually identifying the top combinations, and then formulating the data collection plan based on the analysis and general business knowledge, which can be presented in a markdown cell.




```python
# 1. Identify the top store-family combinations with the highest average absolute error
# We already have cost_optimization_store_family_df loaded and displayed in the previous cell
print("Top 20 Store-Family Combinations with Highest Average Absolute Error:")
print(cost_optimization_store_family_df.to_markdown())

# Manually identify key stores and families from the displayed DataFrame
# Based on the output, key high-error stores include 52, 3, 44, 47, 45, 49, 40, 20, 11, 43.
# Key high-error families include GROCERY I, PRODUCE, BEVERAGES.

## To improve your model based on the cost optimization analysis and mitigate financial risks, we can follow a structured approach


### Action Plan: Improving Model Accuracy for High-Error Segments

1.  **Refine Data Collection for High-Error Segments**:
    * Based on the identified high-error store-family combinations, define and implement processes to collect more granular and relevant data (e.g., detailed promotional data, local events, competitor activities).

2.  **Incorporate New Data into the Model**:
    * Engineer new features from the refined data and integrate them into your BigQuery ML model. This might involve updating the existing model or creating new models for specific segments.

3.  **Retrain and Re-evaluate the Model**:
    * Retrain the sales prediction model using the updated dataset.
    * Evaluate its performance, paying close attention to the accuracy metrics for the previously high-error store-family combinations.

4.  **Implement Segment-Specific Adjustments or Models (Optional but Recommended)**:
    * Based on the re-evaluation, consider if developing separate models or applying post-prediction adjustments for the identified high-error segments is necessary for further improvement.

5.  **Establish a Feedback Loop for Continuous Improvement**:
    * Set up a system for store managers to provide regular feedback on prediction accuracy in high-risk areas.
    * Use this qualitative data to inform future model updates and data collection efforts.

6.  **Monitor and Measure Impact**:
    * Continuously monitor the model's performance and track key business metrics (e.g., inventory levels, waste, stockouts) in the high-error segments to measure the real-world impact of the improvements.

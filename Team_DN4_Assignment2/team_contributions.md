# Racha:
Worked with group in 
* Development and troubleshooting of the data pipeline, successfully pivoting from a failing Dataflow template to a more robust custom Apache Beam Python script to load all datasets into BigQuery.

* Identification and correction a critical schema error in the primary training and test tables, ensuring the family dimension was properly included, which was essential for all subsequent model accuracy.

* Conducting a rigorous, iterative model development process by re-training and re-evaluating multiple BQML models on the corrected data to ensure a fair, evidence-based selection of the best performer.

* Performing a deep, evidence-based investigation for the DIVE analysis, executing queries to provide quantitative proof of the key business drivers, including the impact of holidays and the weekly sales cycle.

* Synthesizing all technical findings and model limitations into a professional, two-page DIVE Summary Report, translating complex results into a strategic and actionable plan.

* Developing and running a query to analyze the business cost of model inaccuracy, identifying the top 20 store-and-family combinations that pose the highest financial risk.

* Refining and elevating the final DIVE report, structuring the action plan around a dual strategy for immediate business application and long-term model improvement to maximize its strategic impact.


# Valerie:
- compared two models
- completed lab 2 + shared learnings to help prepare for assignment 2


# Sameer: 

* Developed a functional data pipeline, adapting techniques and best practices learned from Lab 2. Provided guidance and support to team members to ensure consistent implementation and understanding of data ingestion, transformation, and model readiness workflows.

* Led the development of advanced machine learning models, including an XGBoost regressor, to enhance forecasting accuracy. Tuned and evaluated multiple model configurations to achieve a significant improvement in predictive performance (R² = 0.8055).

* Conducted an in-depth review of the team’s DIVE analysis, identifying gaps in the initial exploration and validation stages. Supplemented the existing insights with additional statistical evaluations and contextual observations to ensure analytical robustness.

* Performed a targeted cost optimization study to identify stores with the highest forecast errors. Quantified financial inefficiencies and proposed store-level improvement opportunities. This analysis extended the DIVE framework by connecting model performance to potential business impact.

* Managed the consolidation of all team deliverables. Ensured that all materials were clearly organized, technically sound, and aligned with project requirements for final submission.

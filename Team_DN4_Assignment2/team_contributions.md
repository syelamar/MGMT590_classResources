Worked with group in 
* Development and troubleshooting of the data pipeline, successfully pivoting from a failing Dataflow template to a more robust custom Apache Beam Python script to load all datasets into BigQuery.

* Identification and correction a critical schema error in the primary training and test tables, ensuring the family dimension was properly included, which was essential for all subsequent model accuracy.

* Conducting a rigorous, iterative model development process by re-training and re-evaluating multiple BQML models on the corrected data to ensure a fair, evidence-based selection of the best performer.

* Performing a deep, evidence-based investigation for the DIVE analysis, executing queries to provide quantitative proof of the key business drivers, including the impact of holidays and the weekly sales cycle.

* Synthesizing all technical findings and model limitations into a professional, two-page DIVE Summary Report, translating complex results into a strategic and actionable plan.

* Developing and running a query to analyze the business cost of model inaccuracy, identifying the top 20 store-and-family combinations that pose the highest financial risk.

* Refining and elevating the final DIVE report, structuring the action plan around a dual strategy for immediate business application and long-term model improvement to maximize its strategic impact.
